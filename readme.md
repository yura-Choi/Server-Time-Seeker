## Server Time Seeker

### What is this?
It's an Chrome extension for getting the server time of the web page you are currently accessing. Also, it can display the current server time vividly in seconds.

* This extension displays the server time as-is. So it may not match your current time.
* There may be pages where this extension is not available. (ex. chrome://extensions) This is not an error in program logic.

### When do you need this extension?
1. MacOS user (there's no seconds on the system clock)
2. Class registration day
3. Booking tickets with fierce competition
4. Otherwise, when you need the clock closest to the server time

### How can I install?
1. Access to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Use `Load unpacked` and select the downloaded repository.
